        <p class="text-muted">Dubai Creek has been described as a natural saltwater creek, tidal inlet, and watercourse
          or waterway in Dubai, United Arab Emirates. It extends about 9 miles inwards and forms a natural port that has
          traditionally been used for trade and transport. The creek ranges from 200 to 1,200 metres in width while the
          average depth is about 6.5 to 7 metres. Previously, it extended to Ras Al Khor Wildlife Sanctuary but as part
          of the new Business Bay Canal and Dubai Canal, it extends a further 13 km to the Persian Gulf. Some sources
          say that the creek historically extended as far inland as Al Ain, and that the Ancient Greeks called it River
          Zara.</p>

          Managed by Jumeirah hotel group, it is one of the tallest hotels in the world, although 39% of its total
          height is made up of non-occupiable space. Burj Al Arab stands on an artificial island that is 280 m from
          Jumeirah Beach and is connected to the mainland by a private curving bridge. The shape of the structure is
          designed to resemble the sail of a ship. It has a helipad near the roof, at a height of 210 m above ground.

      <p>I watched it today with my kids and they loved it. You should have a minimal previous understanding of the
        story, or you will miss 40% of the fun. You should watch Infinity War, Civil War, Black Panther, Age of Ultron,
        Ant-Man and the Wasp before watching Avengers: Endgame. The entire movie pays homage to most of the other Marvel
        superhero movies. You will enjoy it a lot. There is, at the beginning of the movie, a (spoiler alert) head
        dismemberment that is quite impressive. The movie is based on the most-talked action-packed Sci-fi series. The
        movie shows how the Avengers assemble once more in order to reverse Thanos' actions and restore balance to the
        universe. The movie is lengthy, and it does run for 3 hours all worthwhile</p>

      <h5 class="text-success text-capitalize">Director Jon Favreau's The Lion King is a worthwhile reimagining that
        relies on nostalgia over risk-taking. Favreau has simply taken things to their logical conclusion, using
        cutting-edge technology to create something that looks absolutely real while remaining absolutely unreal.

      <p>I took my kids to watch the movie and they loved it. The story shows how a young lion prince, after the murder
        of his father, flees his kingdom only to learn the true meaning of responsibility and bravery. This movie is
        worth a watch for its gorgeous visuals and cinematography. The music was phenomenal. Beyonc√© really brought Nala
        to live but the show stealers were Timon and Pumba. Kids would love it.</p>
